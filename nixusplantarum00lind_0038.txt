‘⁶ This work, so much wanted, appeals irresistibiy to the eye aud the
judgmeut of every cultivator of fruit. The latest varieties are briefly but
correctly described; the best qualities of each are stated; aud, not the

irregular nomenclature which prevails so much in horticulture‚ and often
puzzles‚ not only the unlearned‚ but the professed gardener and pomo-
logist. We cannot too highly recommend this work, as valuable to con-
sult in the choice of fruits‚ and beautiful to look upon.''-—Lit. Gaz.
